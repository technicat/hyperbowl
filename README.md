These are the C# scripts from the Unity version of HyperBowl, not including any third-party or Unity-provided scripts, and also not the original assets licensed from Hyper Entertainment.

The HyperBowl-specific stuff is mostly under the Hyper directory. The other scripts are general-purpose (even the bowling scripts are used for other bowling games), so not all of them were used for HyperBowl.
