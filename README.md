# Unity scripts

Accumulated Unity editor and game scripts I've used over the years, until a couple of years ago, so this is basically an archive.
Some scripts may be out of date, and of course the Javascript/Unityscript is obsolete but here if you want rewrite them.

Games using these scripts are on [Fugu Games](http://fugugames.com/)
